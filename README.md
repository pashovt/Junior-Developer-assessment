Let's define "Data visualization" as the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.

Directions
1. Parse the file at https://www.whiteswandata.com/s/weatherjson.gz and output an "interesting" data visualization based upon data in the file, ideally as a PNG or PDF file, as appropriate.
2. Succinctly comment on the pros/cons of the visualization you made.
3. Send an email with Subject "<Your name> - Small dev test" back to this email address with your commentary in the body and the code, packages specification (if any) and the visualization file as attachments.
